	abstract = "This paper looks at what happens when Communities of Practice are used as a tool for Knowledge Management. The original concept of a Community of Practice appears to have very little in common with the knowledge sharing communities found in Knowledge Management, which are based on a revised view of 'cultivated' communities. We examine the risks and benefits of cultivating Communities of Practice rather than leaving them 'in the wild'. The paper presents the findings from two years of research in a small microelectronics firm to provide some insights into the wild vs domesticated dichotomy and discusses the implications of attempting to tame Communities of Practice in this way.",

	abstract = "This paper has information about the elaboration process of a knowledge Portal based on the relation between university and company. During this process, a study about knowledge management technologies was done to guaranty that the knowledge-life-cycle will be present in the relation between Universities and Companies; it could be implicit or explicit knowledge. One of those technologies used were knowledge management models (we present an alternative knowledge management model focus on University-Company), knowledge maps to identify and locate the knowledge present inside the organization. Theoretically the contribution of Eduardo Bueno, gave us a support to set the model based on his proposed model Intellect. The Project was proposed as a solution to the detected problems because of the lack of communication between University and Company. One of the problems that we found was social problems and others were technological problems, both of them appear as a result of the economical crisis around the world.",

The structure provides a path that how is the organizational learning interdependent with innovation, market, leadership and executive capacity to attain high performance. Analyzing the data collected from the company knowledge management and operation survey (CKMOS), this study uses the factor analysis, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis to examine the model. The results show that: (1) There is positive correlation between the organization learning and the organization performance. (2) The core competitive capabilities (innovation, market, leadership and executive capacity) and organization learning (acquisition, processing, storage, and application of knowledge) all have positive relations with the organization performance. (3) In different stages of the organization learning process, different core competitive capabilities have different impacts on the organization learning.",

	abstract = "Knowledge is the important asset in organizations. Effective knowledge management plays a crucial role in organizational development. Organizational memory (OM) integrates all kinds of organizational knowledge. It is regarded as the central prerequisite for IT support of knowledge management. The paper analyzes the knowledge structure of OM in manufacturing company from internal and external sources of organizational knowledge. OM in manufacturing company is composed of four types, that is, managerial OM, technical OM, cultural OM and marketing OM. These four types of OM components enhance organizational development jointly. Based on the data from international manufacturing strategy survey (IMSS), factor analysis is used to test the classification of OM and organizational performance (OP), canonical correlation analysis is conducted on the impact of OM components on OP in manufacturing companies. The results from structural equation modeling suggest that OM is a dynamic factor, OM formed in different time has different impact on OP.",

	abstract = {Capturing what an organization knows and effectively managing the flow of knowledge across an organization is a challenge. One promising method used to facilitate knowledge transfer is the creation and development of Communities of Practice (COP) within the organization. This paper will focus on the relationship between organizational practices and technology tools for the development and support of "experienced" COP - the level and type of community experienced by the individual members. We present the results from survey measures and company archival data of Technical Account Representatives (TARs) at a Fortune 500 company. Results demonstrate support of our arguments for differential relationships between subcomponents of a model of COP and how these subcomponents differentially relate to tacit and explicit knowledge. We discuss how these results provide value to the flow of knowledge and organizations' ability to support the development of knowledge.},
